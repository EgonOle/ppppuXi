- ppppuXi Changelog -

v1.0 January 15, 2017
* Mod creators can designate a movieclip in the Animation Collection to be a Intermediate Container. An Intermediate Containers is a movie clip that contain multiple movieclips as children that are to be played simultaneously. This allows for changes to the children movieclips such as movement, color changes, sound additions and more effects without modifying the original animation movieclip. An Intermediate Container and its children must all have the same time length and any labels for assigning scene linkage (for transitions) must be placed in the Intermediate Container. To have Xi treat the animation as an Intermediate Container you must select the movieclip in the animation collection and give that instance of the animation a name that starts with "$". For more detailed information on this please read SmLse46's Mod Guide.
* Animation mods now target a character group instead of a single character.
* AnimatedCharacter mods can designate a character group to be a part of. Any characters that are part of the specified group targeted by an animation mod will have animations from the mod added to them.


beta v0.3.5 RC 9 January 1, 2017
* Fixed error that would occur when an animation transition happens with the music off at the moment of the switch.
* mp3 files can now be added to the music player. To add an mp3, edit ModsList.txt to include a path to the mp3 you wish to be loaded. Music added in this way will be unable to have seamless looping without edits made to the mp3 file.
* Fixed issue that occured when adding animations in which the 2nd to last addition being an end link animation and the last addition being a normal animation would make locking the last animation impossible.

beta v0.3.4 RC 8 December 23, 2016
* Added a button for animations transitions. It will appear when an animation has a linked scene that it can switch to.
* Changed how the mods list file is parsed so it will deduce which line ending is used. This fixes an issue where Mac and Linux users would be unable to run the flash without forcing the only line ending accepted in previous program versions (which was CR LF).

beta v0.3.3 RC 7 September 16, 2016
* Included a log reading program to ease user log reporting by allowing them direct access to the log contents.
* Moved where the log and setting save files are stored. They are now stored in the localhost subdirectory of the Flash player's shared object folder. Move your old settings to the localhost folder if you want to keep your old settings.
* End link animations now end on their own. At a certain point, the screen will fade to black before switching to another animation for the character.
* Modified how Animated Characters change their animations so that end link animation be placed anywhere in the animation collection movie clip without causing issues such as the end link animation being selectable on the animation menu.
* Mods can be designated a version to help track differences in releases. Creators can change the version of the mod in it's constructor. Version is set to 0.0/Not Available by default.
* Mods now give information about their contents (type, version, all mods in it if an archive) when loaded standalone.
* Improved logging to mention the file url and version of a mod when successfully loaded. Also when a mod fails to have its contents added the url of the mod is logged.

beta v0.3.2 RC 6 September 6, 2016
* Logging now included the error message that details what the problem was.
* Updated the minimum version of Flash needed during the start up check. Flash Player 11.8 or higher is now necessary to not get the unsupported Flash version message.
* Changed how characters are added so a character is verified first to see if they can be added then the program tries to add their menu icon to the menu list then finally add the character. This prevents a case where the icon would failed to be added but the character that the icon is for was already added.   

beta v0.3.1 RC 5 September 1, 2016
* Fixed issue where AnimatedCharacters mods with certain text characters in their names would cause processing to fail.
* Made mod processing more tolerate in regards to encountering error. Now a failed processing will not prevent the later processing of valid, error free mods.
* Improved error logging during startup loading.

beta v0.3.0 RC 4 August 31, 2016
* Included readme file to detail aspects of the program.
* A Log file of events that occured during the last execution of ppppuXi is now created in order to help track down issues that may occur.
* Modified all the music mods contained in the music pack and ppppuXi to have better looping that should not lead to desyncing caused by audio drifting.
* Changed how animation lock settings are changed. It is now based on the ActionScript class name of the animation, so the program will properly set animation locks regardless of animation mod load order and animation mod load amount.
* Improved the loading of user settings to prevent situations where changes in what mods are loaded from the last program execution would result in all animations of a character or all characters would be locked. In these cases, all animations for the character or all characters will be unlocked.
* Character mods now must have a minimum of 1 animation in order to be accepted by the program.
* Fixed issue in Fiora.swf and Iris.swf where end link animations would have their animations desync from the audio in the animation.
* Removed Route 1 from the Music Pack. It will be available as a seperate mod at a later date.
* Fixed error that would occur when the character set to be displayed first in the user settings is not found.
